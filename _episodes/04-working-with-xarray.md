title: "Working with data in Xarray"
teaching: 40
exercises: 30
questions:
- "How do I load data with Xarray?"
- "How does Xarray index data?"
- "How do I apply operations to the whole or part of an array?"
- "How do I work with time series data in Xarray?"
- "How do I visualise data from Xarray?"
objectives:
- "Understand the concept of lazy loading and how it helps work with datasets bigger than memory"
- "Understand whole array operations and the performance advantages they bring"
- "Apply Xarray operations to load, manipulate and visualise data"
keypoints:
- "Xarray can load NetCDF files"
- "We can address dimensions by their name"
- "With lazy loading data is only loaded into memory when it is requested"
- "We can apply mathematical operations to the whole (or part) of the array, this is more efficient than using a for loop"
- "We can also apply custom functions to operate on the whole or part of the array"
- "Xarray has many useful built in operations it can perform such as interpolating and downsampling"
- "Broadcasting"
- "time series"
- "visualising"
