title: "GPUs"
teaching: 35
exercises: 25
questions:
- "What are GPUs and how do we access them?"
- "How can we use a GPU with Numba?"
- "How can we use a GPU in Pandas, Numpy or SciKit Learn?"
objectives:
- "Understand what the difference between a GPU and CPU is and the performance implications"
- "Apply Numba to use a GPU"
- "Understand that there are GPU enabled replacements for many popular Python libraries"
- "Recall that NVIDIA GPUs can be programmed in CUDA, but this is a very low level operation"
keypoints:
- "GPUs are Graphics Processing Units, they have large numbers of very simple processing cores and are suited to some parallel tasks like machine learning and array operations"
- "Many laptops and desktops won't have very powerful GPUs, instead we'll want to use HPC or Cloud systems to access a GPU."
- "Google's Colab provides free access to GPUs with a Jupyter notebooks interface."
- "Numba can use GPUs with minor modifications to the code."
- "NVIDIA have drop in replacements for Pandas, Numpy and SciKit learn that are GPU accelerated."
